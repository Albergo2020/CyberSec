	Through my research and by automating tasks by using bash scripts, I was able to compile lists of evidence against a certain roulette player and dealer. I attained this evidence by using
automated scripts to search through the work schedules of the dealers and daily logs of the casino's wins and losses. Through these searches I was able to correlate that it is extremely likely that casino
patron Mylie Schmidt was working together with Lucky Duck Casino's roulette dealer Billy Jones in order to cheat money from the casino. My automated scripts made this very obvious as they allowed
me to see that every loss that the casino suffered at the roulette table on March 10th, 12th, and 15th. During each one of those losses Mylie Schmidt was the big winner and Billy Jones was her dealer.
This seems extremely suspicious and should be looked into further by the casino.
